            <p>"A city is a large human settlement. Cities generally have extensive 
            systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, and 
            communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, 
            government organizations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different 
            parties in the process. Historically, city-dwellers have been a small 
            proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of 
            unprecedented and rapid urbanization, roughly half of the world population 
            now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global 
            sustainability.
